Shared map style table: OSM tags -> style id, and style id -> colour/width.

This is the single source of truth for how features look. `bake.py` stores only
the style id in each feature (1 byte); the renderer (preview.py today, the
cluster firmware later) owns the id -> (colour, width) mapping, so restyling
never requires re-baking. Colours are RGB here; the firmware will hold the same
table as RGB565.
