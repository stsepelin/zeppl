# Desktop simulator

Runs the real production widget code in an SDL2 window. The synthetic
driving cycle (`main/simulator/sim_engine.c`) drives `vehicle_data` from
a real pthread, the LVGL UI thread renders, and what you see is exactly
what the device would render — minus the GIF boot screen.

Iterate on layout, colours, animation timing, etc. without flashing.

## One-time setup

macOS:

```sh
brew install sdl2
```

Linux:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

## Build + run

```sh
cd simulator
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build --parallel
./build/vrod_sim
```

Quit by closing the SDL window or hitting Ctrl-C.

## What's connected

| Piece | Source | How |
|---|---|---|
| Widgets | `main/display/widgets/*.c` | Same .c files the firmware compiles |
| Ride screen | `main/display/screen_ride.c` | Same |
| Sim cycle | `main/simulator/sim_engine.c` | Real pthread via FreeRTOS shim |
| Vehicle state | `main/vehicle/vehicle_data.c` | Real pthread mutex |
| Fonts | `main/display/fonts/*.c` | Same baked tables |

## What's *not* connected

- **Boot screen** — relies on the firmware's `EMBED_FILES` for `boot.gif`,
  which is ESP-IDF-only. The simulator loads straight into the ride screen.
- **PPA / DSI / actual panel timing** — the simulator renders to a window;
  panel-level performance characteristics (PSRAM bandwidth, refresh
  tearing) don't show up here.
- **Touch** — the panel has GT911 touch; SDL gives us mouse events instead.

To poke phone notifications without hardware: run the sim, then e.g.
`python3 ../../tools/notify.py --sms "Mom" "running late"` — same TLV
pipeline the cluster's BLE RX uses (Phase 2.5 Stage 4).

If you add a widget to `main/display/widgets/`, add it to the source
list in `CMakeLists.txt` here too.
