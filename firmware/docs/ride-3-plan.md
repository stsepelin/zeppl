# Ride 3 plan — controlled signal-mapping + GPS-map verification

> **Status: planned.** Ride 1 calibrated the core decode; Ride 2 locked the speed
> divisor (188). Ride 3 has two jobs the earlier rides couldn't do: (A) a
> **stationary, one-input-at-a-time capture** to nail the remaining discrete/status
> signals (a moving ride can't isolate them — see `signal-mapping-capture.md`), and
> (B) the first **on-bike verification of the GPS-driven moving map** (task #58).
> One session, ~45 min, powerbank-powered, RX-only tap — nothing here needs TX.

## What Ride 3 must resolve

Carried over from `ride-1-findings.md` / `ride-2-findings.md`, still open:

| Item | Question | How Ride 3 answers it |
|---|---|---|
| **Brake vs clutch** (`48 3B 40` bit5) | Ride 2 saw bit5 on braking, but brake+clutch co-occur when stopping | Part A1 tests 4-5: brake only, then clutch only |
| **Neutral** | Confirmed NOT on the bus (`48 3B 40` disproven); is it truly discrete? | Part A1 test 6: hold N vs 1st, look for any *steady* frame |
| **Oil pressure lamp** | On the bus or discrete (pin 9)? Untestable so far (engine-off capture was empty) | Part A0 test 2: key-on engine-OFF (lamp on) → start → diff |
| **Immobiliser / security** | The key-on handshake frames | Part A0 test 1: key off→on, capture the settle |
| **Fuel level + low-fuel** | RESOLVED — not on the bus (Ride 2 low-vs-full bracket, `ride-2-findings.md`). Discrete sender tap (Phase 6). | done; no Ride 3 capture needed |
| **Speed-cal wizard** (Ride 2 action #2) | Never completed on Ride 2 (sampled ~3 s); fixed in PR #28 | Part B: re-run the wizard, write the divisor to NVS, record divisor/RMS/n |
| **Lean / bank angle** | Any TSSM frame track lean? | Part A1 test 7 (off the stand, rock L/R) |
| **Turn signals** | Re-confirm `48 DA 40 39` bit1=L / bit0=R | Part A1 test 3 |
| **GPS map on bike** (#58) | Does the module drive the map at speed? | Part B: ride with the map view up |
| **Speed 188 + gear** | Locked at bench; confirm against GPS/radar on the road | Part B: cross-check `speed_raw` vs phone-GPS speed |
| **Odometer tick (0.4 m)** | Confirm tick size against GPS distance | Part B: compare `A8 69 10` ticks × 0.4 m to the GPS track length |

## Prep (before leaving)

1. **Firmware build** — the capture + map build:
   - `CONFIG_VROD_J1850=y`, `CONFIG_VROD_J1850_SNIFFER=y` (raw frame log).
   - `CONFIG_VROD_RIDE_LOG=y` (SD capture, laptop-free) + `CONFIG_VROD_RIDE_LOG_DUMP=y`
     (pull over serial afterwards with `tools/ride_log_pull.py`).
   - `CONFIG_VROD_MAP_SD=y` + `CONFIG_VROD_GPS_UART=y` for the map half (Part B).
   - Flash via `/dev/cu.usbmodem5B5F0299541`; verify boot (`streaming NNN tiles`,
     `NMEA reader on UART1`).
2. **microSD** in the cluster (Estonia `map.zmta` already on it) — the ride log and
   the map **share the mount** now (`storage/sd_mount.c`), so both work together.
3. **GPS**: external **active antenna** with clear sky view (the bare patch is
   desensed next to the board — see `gps-module.md`). Confirm a solid fix (badge
   goes green `SAT 6+`) before riding.
4. **RX tap**: pin 7 (LGN/V data) + pin 5 (BK/GN ground) into GPIO 20, per the
   proxy-box T-taps. Bike keeps its stock cluster.
5. **Power**: powerbank on the board's USB (no laptop needed on the road).
6. **Phone**: companion app connected (so the `SAT ⇄ BT` handover + phone fallback
   can be exercised), fine-location granted.
7. **A stopwatch / notes**: call each action out loud and note the clock, so the log
   can be sliced by time afterwards (the whole method in `signal-mapping-capture.md`).

## Part A — stationary controlled capture (on the stand)

The point: **one input at a time, 5+ reps, a few seconds apart**, so a real signal
shows a repeatable pattern. Start the ride log **before touching the key** (bench UI
REC, or it auto-records), announce each test, do it, announce done. Full test table
+ analysis in `signal-mapping-capture.md`.

Order matters: the **key-on handshake and the cold oil-lamp state are one-shot** —
they exist only at the first key-on of the day, so **Part A0 (cold, key OFF) must
run before the engine is ever started.** Only then move to the idling tests (A1).

### A0 — cold start (key OFF → engine running), captured once

1. **Immobiliser / security**: with the log already running, turn the key **OFF →
   ON** (do **not** start yet) and hold. Capture the brief security/fob handshake
   frames before the bus settles to idle keep-alives.
2. **Oil pressure**: leave the engine **OFF** with the key on ~30 s (oil lamp lit),
   then **start** the engine. Diff the frames for the bit that clears when oil
   pressure comes up. (This is the capture Ride 1 never got — its engine-off log was
   empty; and it can't be redone later in the session without cycling the key.)

Do A0 first, in one continuous take. If the handshake or the oil clear looks
ambiguous, kill the engine, wait, and repeat the whole OFF→ON→start once.

### A1 — engine idling (after A0), one input at a time

3. **Turn signals** (warm-up + sanity): L only ×5, R only ×5, hazard. Confirms the
   tap is live and re-confirms `48 DA 40 39` bit1=L / bit0=R.
4. **Brake**: front brake only, 5×, **no clutch, no shift**. Watch `48 3B 40` bit5.
5. **Clutch**: pull clutch only, 5×, in gear, stopped, **no brake**. Splits brake
   vs clutch on the same bit5.
6. **Neutral**: N 30 s → 1st 30 s → N 30 s (clutch as needed). Looking for any frame
   that holds a *steady* state across each block (expected: none → confirms the
   discrete pin-10 tap for Phase 6).
7. **Lean**: off the stand, rock the bike L/R past ~10-20°, a few times each side.
   Any `…40` (TSSM) byte that tracks lean?
(Fuel level was on this list but is **resolved — not on the bus** (Part C); no
fuel test on Ride 3.)

## Part B — the ride (GPS map + speed/gear)

Keep the **map view up** (double-tap from the gauge). Ride a normal ~15-20 min loop
with a GPS-referenced stretch (steady speed on a known road, or the phone's speedo /
a radar sign).

- **GPS module**: badge should read green `SAT n` and the marker should track your
  real position, **heading-up rotation following your course**. Confirm the rotation
  is smooth at road speed (the fixed-point rotate + 30 fps + PPA work).
- **Source handover**: if the module drops (tunnel, tree cover), the badge should flip
  to `BT` (phone) and the map keep going; back to `SAT n` when the module re-locks.
  Note where/when it switches and how fast.
- **Speed**: hold ~50 and ~90 km/h steady past a GPS/radar reference; the ride log
  stores `speed_raw` so the 188 divisor is re-checkable (expect the readout to match
  the reference within a few %).
- **Gear**: watch the gear digit through the range; at divisor 188 it should read
  correctly ~91% of the time (Ride 2). Note any gear that's consistently wrong.
- **Ride log** runs the whole time → `firmware/docs/captures/2026-…-ride-3.log`.
- **Speed-calibration wizard — record the divisor (Ride 2 action #2, still open).**
  The app wizard (phone GPS speed + `speed_raw` → `SpeedCalibrator` → divisor → NVS
  write-back) **never completed on Ride 2** — it sampled only ~3 s in the Composable
  and never hit the ≥5-sample floor; PR #28 moved sampling into the foreground BLE
  service so it now survives screen-off. Re-run it here: **Dev tab → your cluster →
  Speed calibration → Start**, hold two or three steady speeds on the GPS-referenced
  stretch (an assistant/pillion taps, per `ride-2-calibration-plan.md` Part B), let
  it solve, **Finish** to write the divisor to NVS. Record the solved divisor, RMS,
  and sample count for the write-up; expect ~188. This is a hands-free rerun, so also
  possible on a calm parking-lot loop rather than the open road.

## Part C — low-fuel: RESOLVED (not on the bus)

Done before Ride 3 by mining the Ride 2 fuel-stop bracket (leg 2a low tank vs leg
2b full): **no J1850 frame changes between low and full** — fuel level and the
low-fuel lamp are not broadcast; the only fuel traffic is the `A8 83 10`
consumption accumulator. Full method + evidence in `ride-2-findings.md`
("Fuel level / low-fuel — resolved"). So the fuel gauge + low-fuel telltale become
a **discrete fuel-sender tap** (Phase 6), not a decode. **No Ride 3 fuel capture
is needed.**

## Post-ride analysis

1. Pull the log: `tools/ride_log_pull.py` over serial → `firmware/docs/captures/`.
2. Slice by the announced timestamps and diff each toggle window against a quiet
   baseline: `tools/j1850_report.py`, or the awk one-liner in
   `signal-mapping-capture.md` (`$1>=T0 && $1<=T1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn`).
3. For each confirmed mapping, the frame/bit whose payload flips **in lockstep with
   one toggle and only then** is the signal.

## What gets written up after (the deliverables)

- **`ride-3-findings.md`** — the results, with the evidence per signal.
- **`j1850_parse.c`** — decode any signal proven to be on the bus (brake?, fuel
  level?), with the ride evidence in the commit.
- **`PINS.md` + master-plan Phase 6 table** — anything proven **off** the bus
  (neutral, likely oil) becomes a discrete-wire tap (pins 2/9/10/11 dividers).
- **GPS/map**: fold the on-bike result into task #58; note any rotation/handover
  tuning (`GPS_MODULE_STALE_MS`, frame rate) the road exposed.
- **Speed/gear**: confirm 188 holds on the road, or open a re-calibration if not.
- **Speed calibration recorded** (closes Ride 2 action #2): the wizard-solved divisor
  written to NVS, plus divisor/RMS/sample-count in `ride-3-findings.md`; if it lands
  off 188, update `SETTINGS_SPEED_DIVISOR_DEFAULT` / `J1850_SPEED_DIVISOR`.
- **Low-fuel**: RESOLVED before the ride — not on the bus (`ride-2-findings.md`);
  becomes a Phase 6 discrete fuel-sender tap, no decode.
