# Ride 2 findings — speed divisor lock + live-stack review

Second on-bike session (2026-07-09), ~2 rides bracketing a fuel stop:
`2026-07-09-ride-2a.log` (66,106 frames, ~4% bad CRC — the outbound leg) and
`2026-07-09-ride-2b.log` (12,167 frames, 0.17% bad CRC — the return leg). Both
pulled over serial (`CONFIG_VROD_RIDE_LOG_DUMP` + `tools/ride_log_pull.py`).

## Headline: the ride ran on the wrong divisor

The cluster ran Ride 2 at **speed divisor 130**, not the intended 195 — a
leftover written to NVS during bench validation of the config write-back path
(the last manual value sent was 130; it persisted, and a plain reflash does not
erase NVS). Speed therefore read **~45% high** (188/130), and because the gear
indicator is derived from `rpm / speed_mph`, that one error dragged every gear
1-3 positions too high.

## The divisor lock: 188 (counts/km-h = 117)

The ride data pins it independently of any GPS reference. Pairing each speed
frame with the latest RPM (17,006 speed frames) and fitting the exact overall
gear ratios (1st 10.969 … 5th 4.563, rear 240/40R18 ≈ 2.04 m circumference):

- `speed_raw / rpm` clusters at **1.93** and **2.42**, spaced 1.25 — exactly the
  2nd:3rd ratio (7.371/5.9 = 1.249).
- 2nd @1.93 → 116 counts/km-h; 3rd @2.42 → 117 counts/km-h. **Both agree at ~117
  counts per km/h**, matching Ride 1's independent gear-ratio fit.

`speed_mph = speed_raw / divisor`, and `speed_raw = 117 · km/h = 117 · 1.609 ·
mph`, so **divisor = 117 × 1.609 = 188**. Cross-check against the rider's
roadside-radar point (true ≈ 28 km/h): at divisor 188 a true 28 km/h reads
28 km/h. (At the divisor that actually ran, 130, it read ~40 km/h — consistent
with the ~35 km/h the rider saw.)

## Gear derivation confirmed — it was the divisor, not the logic

Replaying `gear_calc` over the time-aligned ride stream:

| divisor | shown gear == true gear | in true 1st, shows |
|---|---|---|
| 130 (what ran) | **2%** | 2nd 68% / 1st 13% / N 17% |
| 188 (correct)  | **91%** | 1st 68% / N 31% |

So "1st gear climbing to 4th, inconsistent" is fully explained by the low
divisor; the gear-band logic is sound at the correct divisor. No gear-code
change needed — it tracks the speed calibration by design.

## Every field-observation, mapped

| Observation | Cause |
|---|---|
| Speed ~45% high vs radar | NVS divisor 130 (bench leftover). Correct = **188**. |
| Gears wrong / inconsistent | Downstream of the divisor (2% → 91% correct at 188). |
| Neutral won't restore after moving | **Neutral is not decoded, and is not on `48 3B 40`** (that frame turned out to be a TSSM brake/deceleration event — see the section below). The "N" shown is only `gear_calc` returning UNKNOWN below 5 mph. Real neutral needs the discrete pin-10 tap (Phase 6). |
| Key-on: oil + immobiliser on stock, nothing on ours | **Not decoded.** The parser handles only RPM / temp / speed / turn / check-engine. Oil (pin 9) + immobiliser are discrete or IM-originated, not in the table. |
| Check-engine blinked early then synced | Correct (`68 88 10`, bit 0x80) — a boot-order blink before the first good frame. |
| Temp OK | Correct (`A8 49 10`, °C = raw − 40). |
| Fuel low-alert / consumption arrow | Stock cluster (as noted). Ours decodes only fuel consumption *ticks* (`A8 83 10`) for economy, not level / low-fuel. |
| App calibration "Finish" never enabled | GPS ran only ~3 s (appops). The wizard samples only while its Composable is foreground+awake, so on a moving bike it never reached the ≥5-sample floor. App-side flaw, not the bus. |

## Fuel calibration captured

The rider did complete the fill-up calibration: the phone stored
`ml_per_tick = 0.309` (`zeppl.fuel.xml`). That now drives the Fuel card's
mpg / L/100km / range-to-empty. (Sanity: ~0.31 mL/tick ≈ 10 L over ~32k ticks.)

## `48 3B 40` — NOT neutral; a TSSM deceleration/brake event

Stage 2 tentatively labelled `48 3B 40` "neutral (bit5) + clutch (bit7)" from
the HarleyDroid table. Analysing it against Ride 2 disproves that and points
somewhere more interesting. Method: the frame is `48 3B 40 XX CRC` (one payload
byte). `XX` only ever takes `0x02 / 0x82` (bit1) or `0x20 / 0xA0` (bit5) — bit1
and bit5 are mutually exclusive, bit7 is independent.

- **Addressing.** Source byte `40` = the **TSSM** (same module that sends the
  `48 DA 40` turn frames and the `68 FF 40` / `29 FE 40` keep-alives). ECM
  frames are source `10`. So this is a TSSM status broadcast, not an
  engine/gearbox signal — the "engine load" `A8 3B 10` is the *ECM's* function
  `3B`, unrelated.
- **bit7 = heartbeat.** Flips between ~80% of consecutive frames — a rolling
  liveness/toggle bit. Not clutch (it is set for 106 samples of moving-at-revs).
- **bit5 is NOT neutral.** It is almost never *held*: 33 of 39 bit5 frames are
  isolated single blips, and **zero** are sustained-while-stopped. Sitting
  parked in neutral for ~5 min at key-on produced flicker, not a steady bit — a
  real neutral switch would hold. Ruled out: neutral, and (by correlation
  tests) lean/turn-cancel (bit5 near a turn edge 26% vs 23% random baseline).
- **bit5 = a deceleration / brake event.** Against random baseline windows,
  bit5 blips coincide with **braking** (median deceleration +2.8 vs 0.0 km/h/s;
  hard-braking >5 km/h/s in 28% vs 1.7%) **and RPM steps** (median 952 vs 210
  rpm). Splitting the 16 moving blips by speed trend: **16 decelerating, 0
  accelerating**, with rpm dropping to idle each time. That rules out
  every-shift clutch (upshifts would fire it); it fires *only* when slowing.
  The 6 key-on standstill blips fit clutch/brake held while starting the engine.

**Conclusion:** `48 3B 40` bit5 is a TSSM **"slowing down / brake" event**
(brake applied, or the clutch pulled while braking to a stop — the two co-occur
when stopping, so the ride can't separate them). It is an *event* (~2.6 s
sampling → brief blips), not a clean held state, so it would make a flaky steady
indicator. **Neutral is not on this frame** — treat neutral as the discrete
pin-10 tap (Phase 6).

To split brake vs clutch and finish mapping the other unknowns, run the
controlled capture in `signal-mapping-capture.md` (one input at a time).

## Fuel level / low-fuel — resolved: NOT on the bus (low-vs-full bracket)

Ride 2 straddled a fuel stop, which is a natural controlled experiment for the
fuel signals: **`2026-07-09-ride-2a.log`** is the leg *before* the stop (~39 min,
the tank draining to its lowest right before the fill — low-fuel lamp on per the
rider), **`2026-07-09-ride-2b.log`** is *after* the fill (full tank, lamp off). If
level or the low-fuel telltale were on J1850, filling the tank would shift some
frame between the two. Three tests, all negative:

1. **Every frame common to both logs, byte by byte** (late-2a low vs 2b full): the
   only bytes that differ are rolling counters — odometer `A8 69 10`, consumption
   `A8 83 10`, speed `48 29 10` — and engine temp `A8 49 10` (~98 °C at the end of
   the long 2a leg vs ~91 °C on the short 2b hop). No analog level-shaped byte.
2. **Bit-level lamp detector** across three windows (2a-early → 2a-late → 2b-full),
   looking for a bit that latches on only when low: one apparent hit, `A8 69 10`
   byte1 bit7 — but that is the odometer tick counter (set-fraction 0.46 over the
   whole 2a log = a coin flip, a windowing artifact, not a latching lamp).
3. **Low-only broadcast** (a header present when low, absent when full, or vice
   versa): none at count ≥ 10 either way. The only fuel-function header is
   `A8 83 10`, a `0A` + 24-bit consumption **accumulator** (climbs monotonically,
   resets to zero at each key-on) — identical in structure low vs full, no level or
   reserve bit.

**Conclusion:** fuel **level** and the **low-fuel lamp** are not broadcast on
J1850 on this VRSCF — filling the tank changed zero bus frames. The stock cluster
reads the fuel-level sender directly (discrete analog wire). Ours can only derive
consumption / economy / range from the `A8 83 10` ticks (`ml_per_tick = 0.309`,
above). A real fuel gauge + low-fuel telltale needs the fuel sender tapped as a
**discrete input** (Phase 6), the same class as neutral (pin 10) and oil (pin 9).
This closes the fuel question — no further ride capture is needed for it.

## Actions

1. **Divisor → 188.** Reset the cluster's NVS `speed_div` (clear the bench 130)
   and move the compile-time default 195 → 188 (Ride 1 physics + Ride 2 physics
   + radar all agree). Done (PR #27).
2. **Fix the GPS calibration wizard** so sampling survives screen-off — collect
   in the foreground BLE service instead of the Composable. Done (PR #28).
3. **Neutral is a discrete pin-10 tap** (Phase 6), not `48 3B 40` (see above).
   The `48 3B 40` brake/clutch event is worth confirming via the controlled
   capture before any decode.
4. **Oil / immobiliser** — decode via the controlled capture
   (`signal-mapping-capture.md`): a bench signal isn't identifiable from a
   moving ride, only from toggling one input at a time.
5. **Fuel level / low-fuel is a discrete sender tap** (Phase 6), not on the bus
   — resolved by the low-vs-full bracket above, no further capture needed.
