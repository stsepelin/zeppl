# firmware

ESP-IDF cluster firmware for the Waveshare ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-3.4C.

This is the bike-side half of [harley](../). Drives the 800×800 round
IPS gauge, reads the J1850 VPW bus (planned), hosts a BLE peripheral
that the [Android companion](../companion/) connects to.

## Build

```sh
# From the repo root, via the top-level Makefile (sources IDF for you):
make build-fw          # idf.py build
make flash-monitor     # flash + monitor (PORT=/dev/cu.usbmodemXXX to override)
make test-fw           # host unit tests + 100% coverage gate
make sim               # desktop SDL2 + LVGL simulator (brew install sdl2)

# Or directly with IDF in your shell:
cd firmware
. $IDF_PATH/export.sh
idf.py build
```

## Targets + toolchain

- **MCU**: ESP32-P4 dual-core RISC-V @ 360 MHz, **silicon rev v1.3** (see
  `docs/ble-bringup-bisect.md` for why the silicon rev matters)
- **ESP-IDF**: v6.0.1 (`esp-15.2.0_20251204` toolchain, GCC 15.2 / binutils 2.45)
- **LVGL**: 9.x via `lvgl/lvgl` managed component
- **BSP**: Waveshare `esp32_p4_wifi6_touch_lcd_xc` (under `components/`)
- **BLE controller**: ESP32-C6 coprocessor, talked to via SDIO (esp_hosted)

## Tests

```sh
make test-fw
```

Coverage gate: 100 % line + branch on the pure-logic modules listed in
`test_apps/host/README.md`. Widget caches have behaviour tests against
the LVGL stub. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the testing model.

CI runs the same gate via `.github/workflows/host-tests.yml`. Firmware
itself is built in `.github/workflows/firmware-build.yml` against the
`espressif/idf:v6.0.1` container.

## Working notes

See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for conventions (LVGL setter caches, V-Rod
palette, font discipline, sdkconfig gotchas, the binutils 2.45 link-trap
workaround).

managed components keep their own licenses (Apache 2.0 / MIT) in their
respective subdirectories.
