# harley — monorepo

Two top-level components, one git tree:

- **`firmware/`** — ESP-IDF cluster firmware for the Waveshare
  ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-3.4C. Drives the 800×800 round MIPI-DSI
  display, runs the gauge UI, hosts the BLE peripheral that the
  companion connects to. Working notes for the firmware are in
  `firmware/CLAUDE.md`.
- **`companion/`** — Android BLE-central app that pairs with the
  cluster's peripheral, relays phone notifications + media metadata
  over the GATT link. Build notes are in `companion/README.md`.

Cross-system docs live at the repo root in `docs/`:
- `PROJECT-BRIEF.md` — what this project is, current status.
- `00-MASTER-PROJECT-PLAN.md` — full build plan + phases + budget.
- `02-PHASE2.5-OFFBIKE-PLAN.md` — completed phase (touch / settings /
  BLE / camera framework).
- `03-PHASE3-J1850-GPS-PLAN.md` — the active phase (J1850 bus + IM
  simulation + GPS bring-up).

Firmware-internal docs are under `firmware/docs/`:
- `01-PHASE2-DISPLAY-PLAN.md` — the (complete) gauge-UI phase.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — threading, render pipeline, boot sequence.
- `DISPLAY-PERF-AND-MEMORY.md` — render/RAM constraints; read before
  touching anything that draws.
- `ble-bringup-bisect.md` — resolution notes for the binutils 2.45 /
  IDF P4-rev<3 link trap that blocked BLE bring-up for a while.
- `waveshare-reference/` — vendor examples kept for reference.

## Working in the monorepo

```sh
# Firmware
cd firmware
. $IDF_PATH/export.sh
idf.py build flash monitor

# Firmware host unit tests (no MCU needed)
cd firmware/test_apps/host
cmake -B build -S . && cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build

# Firmware desktop simulator (macOS: brew install sdl2)
cd firmware/simulator
cmake -B build -S . && cmake --build build && ./build/vrod_sim

# Companion (Android)
cd companion
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

CI: `.github/workflows/firmware-build.yml` (`idf.py build` inside `firmware/`),
`.github/workflows/host-tests.yml` (Unity + 100 % line/branch gate on the
policy scope, inside `firmware/test_apps/host/`), and
`.github/workflows/lint.yml` (clang-format + hygiene hooks via pre-commit).

## Code style (applies to both components)

- **No comments that restate the code.** A comment earns its keep by
  explaining *why* — non-obvious constraint, workaround, calibration
  that came out of an experiment. If removing it wouldn't confuse a
  reader, delete it.
- **No emoji** anywhere — code, commits, UI strings.

Firmware-specific conventions (caches on every widget setter, V-Rod
palette, JBM Bold font discipline, etc.) are in `firmware/CLAUDE.md`.
