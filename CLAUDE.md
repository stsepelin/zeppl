# V-Rod cluster — working notes

Digital instrument cluster for a 2009 Harley-Davidson V-Rod. Waveshare
ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-3.4C, 800×800 round MIPI-DSI panel.
ESP-IDF v6.0.1 / LVGL 9.4 / GCC 15 (RISC-V).

Background:

- `docs/PROJECT-BRIEF.md` — what we're building
- `docs/00-MASTER-PROJECT-PLAN.md` — phases / roadmap
- `docs/01-PHASE2-DISPLAY-PLAN.md` / `docs/02-PHASE2.5-OFFBIKE-PLAN.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — threading, render pipeline, decision history

This file is for *how to work in the code*, not what we're working
toward or why each decision is the way it is.

## Build & run

```sh
# Firmware
. $IDF_PATH/export.sh
idf.py build flash monitor

# Host unit tests (clang/gcc + lcov; macOS: brew install lcov)
cd test_apps/host
cmake -B build -S . && cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build
./coverage.sh                # full lcov report, opens HTML

# Desktop simulator (macOS: brew install sdl2)
cd simulator
cmake -B build -S . && cmake --build build && ./build/vrod_sim
```

CI: `host-tests.yml` (Unity + 100 % line/branch gate on the policy scope)
and `firmware-build.yml` (`espressif/idf:v6.0.1` container).

## Code style

- **No comments that restate the code.** A comment earns its keep by
  explaining *why* — non-obvious constraint, workaround, calibration that
  came out of an experiment. If removing it wouldn't confuse a reader,
  delete it.
- **No emoji** anywhere — code, commits, UI strings.
- **Caches everywhere.** Every widget's `*_set_*()` short-circuits when
  the input matches the previous frame:

  ```c
  if (sd->has_value && sd->last_x == x) return;
  sd->last_x = x;
  sd->has_value = true;
  ```

  Tested in `test_widget_caches.c`. Adding a setter without the cache
  silently regresses UI FPS.
- **V-Rod palette in `main/display/theme.h`** — never hex-literal a colour
  in a widget. Add a name to the palette if you need a new shade.
- **JetBrains Mono Bold** for numeric readouts (tabular digits), MDI font
  for icons. Boot screen text-fallback also uses JBM Bold — Montserrat is
  intentionally off (only the 14-pt size stays, as LVGL's required default).
- **Pure logic separated from LVGL.** New math / formatting / state-machine
  code goes in its own free-function module under `main/`, so it can be
  tested on host. That's how `gear_table`, `sim_math`, `format`, `units`,
  `smooth`, `settings` ended up as their own files.

## How things fit together

One-liners — see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the why.

- `vehicle_data` is the mutex-guarded latest-value store between
  producer (sim, J1850 later) and UI.
- Sim + event watcher + audio on **core 0**; LVGL + `ui_update_task`
  on **core 1**. Don't bleed UI/render work onto core 0 or input/audio
  work onto core 1.
- Tach uses pre-baked ARGB8888 sprites in PSRAM (glow, cursor, track
  ring, scale ticks). Per-frame cost is a blit, not a redraw.
- Upshift warning blinks the **gear digit** (not the tach), driven by
  `gear_indicator_set_warning`. The tach was tried and abandoned — see
  the architecture doc for the four-iteration story.
- `smooth_step(cur, target)` is the canonical "ease toward a target"
  helper (25 % per call + ±1 snap).
- Settings: pure `settings.c` (host-tested) + `settings_store.c` (NVS).
  Apply runs inside the LVGL lock, which serialises reads/writes.

## Patches & gotchas (operational)

- **`AnimatedGIF.h` MAX_WIDTH 480 → 1024.** LVGL's bundled GIF decoder
  hard-caps width at 480; our boot GIF used to be 800. Patched at CMake
  configure time in `main/CMakeLists.txt` — idempotent, re-applies after
  a fresh `managed_components/` fetch. Don't manually edit the patched
  file.
- **PPA is off** (`CONFIG_LV_USE_PPA` unset, `CONFIG_LV_DRAW_BUF_ALIGN=4`).
  Caused horizontal banding on this BSP. Re-enable only with a
  known-good alignment story.
- **GT911 touch** sometimes fails on cold boot; the BSP retries with a
  100 ms delay. First-boot serial logs aren't always clean.
- **LVGL press events don't reach the ride screen** on this BSP — hover
  does but `LV_EVENT_PRESSED` / `_LONG_PRESSED` never fire. We poll
  `lv_indev_get_state()` from `event_watcher_task` instead.
- **`bsp_display_brightness_set()` before `_backlight_on()`** at boot
  to avoid a 100 % flash. Below ~25 % duty the LCD goes fully black,
  so `SETTINGS_BRIGHTNESS_MIN = 30` in `settings.h` clamps loads.
- **Don't try Lottie again** for the boot screen unless ThorVG's
  rasteriser gets much faster.

## Testing

Full policy in `test_apps/host/README.md`. Short version:

- **In scope (100 % line + branch required):** pure-logic modules —
  `gear_table.c`, `sim_math.c`, `format.c`, `units.c`, `smooth.c`,
  `settings.c`, `vehicle_data.c`.
- **Behaviour-checked, not coverage-measured:** every label-based widget
  has cache-regression tests via the LVGL stub.
- **Out of scope:** fonts (generated), boot/screen wiring (BSP glue),
  `tach_arc.c` (LVGL stub would double in size for marginal value).

When you add code:

- **New pure-logic module** → add a test, add the `.c` to `vrod_pure`
  in `test_apps/host/CMakeLists.txt`, add it to the `--extract` filter
  in `.github/workflows/host-tests.yml` and `coverage.sh`, add a row
  to the policy table in `test_apps/host/README.md`.
- **New widget setter** → add the cache short-circuit + a regression
  test in `test_widget_caches.c`.
- **New widget** → if label-based, add to `vrod_widgets` + cache test.
  If arc/scale/image-heavy, mark out-of-scope.

## When in doubt

- **Adding a managed component** — check `memory/feedback_ecosystem_compat.md`
  first; we burned time on a Lottie/ThorVG dead end by not researching
  upstream support before recommending a downgrade.
- **Editing `managed_components/`** — usually wrong. Prefer a CMake
  configure-time patch in `main/CMakeLists.txt` so it survives a fresh
  fetch.
- **Anything visual on the round display** — verify in the simulator
  before flashing. It runs the real widget code; if it looks right
  there it looks right on device.
