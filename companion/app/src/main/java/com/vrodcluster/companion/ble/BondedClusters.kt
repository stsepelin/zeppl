/**
 * Phone-side bond management for V-Rod clusters.
 *
 * The cluster's BT subpage exposes "Forget all devices" which clears
 * the *cluster's* NVS-stored bond. That's only half the symmetry —
 * the phone still has its own bond record for the cluster's MAC,
 * and Samsung in particular hides paired BLE peripherals from the
 * "Pair new device" scan list, so once a stale bond exists on the
 * phone you can't easily get rid of it through the OS settings.
 *
 * This module lets the companion app do the equivalent operation
 * on the phone side: find every BluetoothDevice the OS considers
 * bonded with the name "V-Rod Cluster" and remove the bond.
 *
 * [BluetoothDevice.removeBond] is a hidden API ([@hide]) but has
 * been stable since API 1 and is accessible via reflection. Most
 * production Android apps that need this functionality (Wear, fitness
 * trackers, etc.) use the same pattern.

     * bonds on Samsung phones, which sometimes cache an alias or
     * truncated name at pairing time; the user-facing symptom was
     * "the Forget button never shows up". The current filter is
     * deliberately permissive:
     *
     *   - device type is LE or DUAL (no classic-only BR/EDR speakers),
     *   - cached name OR alias contains "v-rod" (case-insensitive), OR
     *     the entry has no name at all (some BLE bonds keep only the
     *     MAC, and we'd rather list it than silently hide it).
     *
     * The trade-off: a user with another BLE peripheral whose name
     * happens to share the "v-rod" substring would see it here. Worst
     * case the user unpairs an unrelated device — recoverable by
     * re-pairing it through their phone's normal flow.
